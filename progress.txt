## Story 1.1: Wire up ZoneLinker integration to climate entity - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The ZoneLinker integration to the climate entity was already implemented in the codebase. The implementation includes:

1. **on_zone_heating_started() call** (climate.py:1446-1450): Notifies ZoneLinker when zone begins heating
2. **is_zone_delayed() check** (climate.py:1428-1434): Blocks heating activation if zone is delayed
3. **extra_state_attributes** (climate.py:1000-1007): Exposes zone_link_delayed and zone_link_delay_remaining

### Work Done
Added 6 integration tests to tests/test_zone_linking.py:
- test_integration_heating_start_triggers_linked_zone_notification
- test_integration_delayed_zone_skips_heating_activation
- test_integration_delay_expiration_allows_heating_to_resume
- test_integration_extra_state_attributes_show_delay_status
- test_integration_multiple_heating_starts_dont_re_notify
- test_integration_heater_off_resets_heating_state

### Test Results
All 16 tests in tests/test_zone_linking.py pass (10 existing + 6 new integration tests)
All 233 project tests pass.

## Story 1.2: Fix race condition in CentralController startup task - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The CentralController class had a potential race condition where concurrent calls to `update()` during the startup delay period could lead to:
1. Multiple startup tasks being created
2. Inconsistent state in `_heater_waiting_for_startup` and `_cooler_waiting_for_startup` flags
3. Race conditions between task cancellation and the task's finally block

### Work Done
Added `asyncio.Lock` to protect all startup-related state:

1. **Added `_startup_lock` field** to CentralController.__init__
2. **Protected `_update_heater()` method** with lock to serialize heater state access
3. **Protected `_update_cooler()` method** with lock to serialize cooler state access
4. **Renamed internal methods to `_unlocked` suffix** to indicate they require caller to hold lock:
   - `_start_heater_with_delay_unlocked()`
   - `_start_cooler_with_delay_unlocked()`
   - `_cancel_heater_startup_unlocked()`
   - `_cancel_cooler_startup_unlocked()`
5. **Protected delayed startup callbacks** to acquire lock when checking demand and resetting state
6. **Added deadlock avoidance** in cancel methods by releasing lock while awaiting task cancellation

Added 4 new tests to tests/test_central_controller.py:
- test_concurrent_update_calls_during_startup_delay
- test_task_cancellation_race_condition
- test_concurrent_heater_and_cooler_updates
- test_lock_released_after_cancellation

### Test Results
All 11 tests in tests/test_central_controller.py pass (7 existing + 4 new concurrency tests)
All 237 project tests pass.
