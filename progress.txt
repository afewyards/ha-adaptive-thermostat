## Story 1.1: Wire up ZoneLinker integration to climate entity - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The ZoneLinker integration to the climate entity was already implemented in the codebase. The implementation includes:

1. **on_zone_heating_started() call** (climate.py:1446-1450): Notifies ZoneLinker when zone begins heating
2. **is_zone_delayed() check** (climate.py:1428-1434): Blocks heating activation if zone is delayed
3. **extra_state_attributes** (climate.py:1000-1007): Exposes zone_link_delayed and zone_link_delay_remaining

### Work Done
Added 6 integration tests to tests/test_zone_linking.py:
- test_integration_heating_start_triggers_linked_zone_notification
- test_integration_delayed_zone_skips_heating_activation
- test_integration_delay_expiration_allows_heating_to_resume
- test_integration_extra_state_attributes_show_delay_status
- test_integration_multiple_heating_starts_dont_re_notify
- test_integration_heater_off_resets_heating_state

### Test Results
All 16 tests in tests/test_zone_linking.py pass (10 existing + 6 new integration tests)
All 233 project tests pass.

## Story 1.2: Fix race condition in CentralController startup task - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The CentralController class had a potential race condition where concurrent calls to `update()` during the startup delay period could lead to:
1. Multiple startup tasks being created
2. Inconsistent state in `_heater_waiting_for_startup` and `_cooler_waiting_for_startup` flags
3. Race conditions between task cancellation and the task's finally block

### Work Done
Added `asyncio.Lock` to protect all startup-related state:

1. **Added `_startup_lock` field** to CentralController.__init__
2. **Protected `_update_heater()` method** with lock to serialize heater state access
3. **Protected `_update_cooler()` method** with lock to serialize cooler state access
4. **Renamed internal methods to `_unlocked` suffix** to indicate they require caller to hold lock:
   - `_start_heater_with_delay_unlocked()`
   - `_start_cooler_with_delay_unlocked()`
   - `_cancel_heater_startup_unlocked()`
   - `_cancel_cooler_startup_unlocked()`
5. **Protected delayed startup callbacks** to acquire lock when checking demand and resetting state
6. **Added deadlock avoidance** in cancel methods by releasing lock while awaiting task cancellation

Added 4 new tests to tests/test_central_controller.py:
- test_concurrent_update_calls_during_startup_delay
- test_task_cancellation_race_condition
- test_concurrent_heater_and_cooler_updates
- test_lock_released_after_cancellation

### Test Results
All 11 tests in tests/test_central_controller.py pass (7 existing + 4 new concurrency tests)
All 237 project tests pass.

## Story 1.3: Prevent ModeSync feedback loop - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The ModeSync class is responsible for synchronizing HEAT/COOL modes across multiple zones. When one zone changes mode, it triggers the sync handler which then changes mode on other zones. Without protection, this creates a feedback loop:
1. Zone A changes to HEAT → triggers sync to Zone B
2. Zone B changes to HEAT → triggers reverse sync back to Zone A
3. Infinite loop potential (though stopped by mode equality check)

### Work Done
Added `_sync_in_progress` flag to prevent feedback loops:

1. **Added `_sync_in_progress` field** (coordinator.py:420): Boolean flag initialized to False
2. **Check flag at start of on_mode_change()**: Skip sync if already syncing
3. **Set flag before syncing** (coordinator.py:500): Protected sync logic with flag
4. **try/finally pattern** (coordinator.py:500-536): Ensures flag is cleared even on exceptions
5. **Added `is_sync_in_progress()` helper** (coordinator.py:611-617): For testing and debugging

Added 4 new tests to tests/test_mode_sync.py:
- test_sync_not_triggering_reverse_sync
- test_multiple_zones_syncing_without_loop
- test_sync_flag_cleared_on_exception
- test_is_sync_in_progress_method

### Test Results
All 11 tests in tests/test_mode_sync.py pass (7 existing + 4 new feedback loop tests)
All 241 project tests pass.

## Story 1.4: Add error handling and retry logic to CentralController - COMPLETED

### Analysis
The CentralController class makes service calls to turn on/off main heater and cooler switches. These calls could fail due to:
1. Service not found (entity doesn't exist)
2. Home Assistant errors (transient failures, communication issues)
3. Unexpected exceptions

Without error handling, failures would propagate and potentially crash the controller.

### Work Done
Added comprehensive error handling with retry logic:

1. **Added imports** (coordinator.py:10): `HomeAssistantError`, `ServiceNotFound` from homeassistant.exceptions
2. **Added constants** (coordinator.py:20-23):
   - `MAX_SERVICE_CALL_RETRIES = 3`
   - `BASE_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS = 1.0`
   - `CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_WARNING_THRESHOLD = 3`
3. **Added failure tracking** (coordinator.py:169): `_consecutive_failures: dict[str, int]` to track failures per entity
4. **Refactored `_turn_on_switch` and `_turn_off_switch`** (coordinator.py:357-380): Return boolean success status, delegate to `_call_switch_service`
5. **Added `_call_switch_service` method** (coordinator.py:382-470):
   - Try/except for `ServiceNotFound` (no retry - immediate failure)
   - Try/except for `HomeAssistantError` (retry with exponential backoff)
   - Try/except for general `Exception` (retry with exponential backoff)
   - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays between retries
   - Failure counter reset on success
   - Appropriate logging at debug/warning/error levels
6. **Added `_record_failure` method** (coordinator.py:472-489): Track consecutive failures and emit warnings at threshold
7. **Added `get_consecutive_failures` method** (coordinator.py:491-500): For external monitoring

Added 11 new tests to tests/test_central_controller.py:
- test_service_call_success
- test_service_not_found_no_retry
- test_home_assistant_error_with_retry
- test_all_retries_exhausted
- test_consecutive_failure_warning_threshold
- test_failure_counter_reset_on_success_after_failures
- test_unexpected_exception_triggers_retry
- test_turn_off_also_uses_retry_logic
- test_get_consecutive_failures_returns_zero_for_unknown_entity
- test_multiple_switches_independent_failure_tracking
- test_exponential_backoff_timing

### Test Results
All 22 tests in tests/test_central_controller.py pass (11 existing + 11 new error handling tests)
All 252 project tests pass.
